Typical ways to solve circular array problems. Java solution.

The first typical way to solve circular array problems is to extend the original array to twice length, 2nd half has the same element as first half. Then everything become simple.
Naive by simple solution, just look for the next greater element directly. Time complexity: O(n^2).

public class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int num : nums) {
            max = Math.max(max, num);
        }
        
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        int[] temp = new int[n * 2];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) {
            temp[i] = nums[i % n];
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result[i] = -1;
            if (nums[i] == max) continue;
            
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n * 2; j++) {
                if (temp[j] > nums[i]) {
                    result[i] = temp[j];
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
The second way is to use a stack to facilitate the look up. First we put all indexes into the stack, smaller index on the top. Then we start from end of the array look for the first element (index) in the stack which is greater than the current one. That one is guaranteed to be the Next Greater Element. Then put the current element (index) into the stack.
Time complexity: O(n).

public class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            stack.push(i);
        }
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            result[i] = -1;
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums[stack.peek()] <= nums[i]) {
                stack.pop();
            }
            if (!stack.isEmpty()){
                result[i] = nums[stack.peek()];
            }
            stack.add(i);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}

I think this solution is really concise! But I want to add some detailed explainations to show why we do so to solve the problem, This problem is in fact similiar to the problem "Largest Rectangle under the histogram "

We need to keep the monotically decreasing substring that contains all the char in the s. So we just use a vector to mimic the stack! Just similiar to the previous many solutions that use the vector to simulate a stack.

In fact this problem is also similiar to the problem that the maximum in the sliding windows, I strongly recommend you to grasp the sliding windows solutions.

Here is the AC C++ implementation

class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicateLetters(string s) {
        vector<int> dict(256, 0);
        vector<bool> visited(256, false);
        for(auto ch : s)  dict[ch]++;
        string result = "0";
        /** the key idea is to keep a monotically increasing sequence **/
        for(auto c : s) {
            dict[c]--;
            /** to filter the previously visited elements **/
            if(visited[c])  continue;
            while(c < result.back() && dict[result.back()]) {
                visited[result.back()] = false;
                result.pop_back();
            }
            result += c;
            visited[c] = true;
        }
        return result.substr(1);
    }
};

Before diving into the solution, we first introduce a very important stack type, which is called monotone stack .

What is monotonous increase stack?
Roughly speaking, the elements in the an monotonous increase stack keeps an increasing order.

The typical paradigm for monotonous increase stack:
for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
  while(!in_stk.empty() && in_stk.top() > A[i]){
    in_stk.pop();
  }
  in_stk.push(A[i]);
}
What can monotonous increase stack do?
(1) find the previous less element of each element in a vector with O(n) time:
What is the previous less element of an element?
For example:
[3, 7, 8, 4]
The previous less element of 7 is 3.
The previous less element of 8 is 7.
The previous less element of 4 is 3.
There is no previous less element for 3.
For simplicity of notation, we use abbreviation PLE to denote Previous Less Element.

C++ code (by slitghly modifying the paradigm):
Instead of directly pushing the element itself, here for simplicity, we push the index.
We do some record when the index is pushed into the stack.
// previous_less[i] = j means A[j] is the previous less element of A[i].
// previous_less[i] = -1 means there is no previous less element of A[i].
vector<int> previous_less(A.size(), -1);
for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
  while(!in_stk.empty() && A[in_stk.top()] > A[i]){
    in_stk.pop();
  }
  previous_less[i] = in_stk.empty()? -1: in_stk.top();
  in_stk.push(i);
}
(2) find the next less element of each element in a vector with O(n) time:
What is the next less element of an element?
For example:
[3, 7, 8, 4]
The next less element of 8 is 4.
The next less element of 7 is 4.
There is no next less element for 3 and 4.
For simplicity of notation, we use abbreviation NLE to denote Next Less Element.

C++ code (by slighly modifying the paradigm):
We do some record when the index is poped out from the stack.
// next_less[i] = j means A[j] is the next less element of A[i].
// next_less[i] = -1 means there is no next less element of A[i].
vector<int> previous_less(A.size(), -1);
for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
  while(!in_stk.empty() && A[in_stk.top()] > A[i]){
    auto x = in_stk.top(); in_stk.pop();
    next_less[x] = i;
  }
  in_stk.push(i);
}
How can the monotonous increase stack be applied to this problem?
For example:
Consider the element 3 in the following vector:

                            [2, 9, 7, 8, 3, 4, 6, 1]
			     |                    |
	             the previous less       the next less 
	                element of 3          element of 3

After finding both NLE and PLE of 3, we can determine the
distance between 3 and 2(previous less) , and the distance between 3 and 1(next less).
In this example, the distance is 4 and 3 respectively.

How many subarrays with 3 being its minimum value?
The answer is 4*3.

9 7 8 3 
9 7 8 3 4 
9 7 8 3 4 6 
7 8 3 
7 8 3 4 
7 8 3 4 6 
8 3 
8 3 4 
8 3 4 6 
3 
3 4 
3 4 6
How much the element 3 contributes to the final answer?
It is 3*(4*3).
What is the final answer?
Denote by left[i] the distance between element A[i] and its PLE.
Denote by right[i] the distance between element A[i] and its NLE.

The final answer is,
sum(A[i]*left[i]*right[i] )

The solution (One pass)
class Solution {
public:
  int sumSubarrayMins(vector<int>& A) {
    stack<pair<int, int>> in_stk_p, in_stk_n;
    // left is for the distance to previous less element
    // right is for the distance to next less element
    vector<int> left(A.size()), right(A.size());
		
    //initialize
    for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) left[i] =  i + 1;
    for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) right[i] = A.size() - i;
		
    for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
      // for previous less
      while(!in_stk_p.empty() && in_stk_p.top().first > A[i]) in_stk_p.pop();
      left[i] = in_stk_p.empty()? i + 1: i - in_stk_p.top().second;
      in_stk_p.push({A[i],i});
			
      // for next less
      while(!in_stk_n.empty() && in_stk_n.top().first > A[i]){
        auto x = in_stk_n.top();in_stk_n.pop();
        right[x.second] = i - x.second;
      }
      in_stk_n.push({A[i], i});
    }

    int ans = 0, mod = 1e9 +7;
    for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
      ans = (ans + A[i]*left[i]*right[i])%mod;
    }
    return ans;
  }
};

The last thing that needs to be mentioned for handling duplicate elements:
Method: Set strict less and non-strict less(less than or equal to) for finding NLE and PLE respectively. The order doesn't matter.

For example, the above code for finding NLE is strict less, while PLE is actually non-strict less.
Remark: Although in both loop conditions the signs are set as >, for NLE, we make records inside the loop, while for PLE, records are done outside the loop.
